## Introduction
Beyond the Mountain is an adventure puzzle game themed around nihilism, combining Chinese ink painting style with modern game design concepts to create a unique gaming experience. This project aims to explore the disappointment and self-discovery in an individual's quest for meaning. Through six interrelated game levels, it portrays the protagonist's emotional journey through different stages of life.

## Phase 1: Research and Conceptualization
When I first started contemplating this project, what immediately sprang to mind was Chinese culture and art. Being Chinese myself, this venture represents a journey of cultural roots discovery and a process of self-identity affirmation, as well as an excellent method for cultural dissemination. Besides Chinese culture, the philosophical themes that particularly captivate me are existentialism and nihilism, and integrating these with Chinese cultural elements helped narrow down my research scope.
