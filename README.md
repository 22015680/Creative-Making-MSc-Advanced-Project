## Introduction
Beyond the Mountain is an adventure puzzle game themed around nihilism, combining Chinese ink painting style with modern game design concepts to create a unique gaming experience. This project aims to explore the disappointment and self-discovery in an individual's quest for meaning. Through six interrelated game levels, it portrays the protagonist's emotional journey through different stages of life.

## Phase 1: Research and Conceptualization
When I first started contemplating this project, what immediately sprang to mind was Chinese culture and art. Being Chinese myself, this venture represents a journey of cultural roots discovery and a process of self-identity affirmation, as well as an excellent method for cultural dissemination. Besides Chinese culture, the philosophical themes that particularly captivate me are existentialism and nihilism, and integrating these with Chinese cultural elements helped narrow down my research scope.  

In my exploration of nihilistic philosophy, I became intrigued by its manifestation in modern Chinese literature. This led me to focus on contemporary poet Wang Jiaxin's Beyond the Mountain, and also reminded me of Su Shi's Written on the Wall of West Forest Temple. Although Su Shi's poem originally intended to convey the idea that understanding the true nature and entirety of things requires transcending narrow confines and subjective biases, the line “only because I am in this mountain” from his poem offers an epiphanic realization, thereby establishing the mountain as a central theme.  

The philosophical contemplation of nihilism further extended to the theme of dystopia. Reflecting on literary works with dystopian themes in Chinese history, I was naturally drawn to Tao Yuanming's The Peach Blossom Spring. Thus, the game’s narrative setting was tentatively determined—a utopia during China’s Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, named The Peach Blossom Spring. Following this backdrop, I conducted detailed research: delving deeply into nihilism, with a focus on the sentiments of disillusionment expressed in Beyond the Mountain and The Peach Blossom Spring. By reading related philosophical literature, I analyzed the manifestations and impacts of nihilism in social life. As my intention was to develop a game, I also researched game design methodologies, such as reading books like The Art of Game Design and Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals, drawing knowledge in game planning and arrangement. Given that narrative-driven games can better convey themes of nihilism, I particularly focused on studying the design of puzzle games, creating puzzle levels to guide the plot development. Therefore, I researched puzzle and narrative games like Rusty Lake, Detroit: Become Human, and What Remains of Edith Finch, learning about their narrative structures and puzzle designs.  

Beyond the design of the game levels, artistic style and musical effects are also crucial components of the game. Hence, I studied the Chinese ink painting style and thoroughly explored how to integrate it into the visual design of a modern game, creating a unique artistic style for the game. Additionally, I researched sounds from traditional Chinese musical instruments like the Guqin, ingeniously integrating them into the game.
